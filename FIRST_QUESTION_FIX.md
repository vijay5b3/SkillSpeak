# üîß Fix Applied: Special Token Filter for First Question

## Issue Identified
When asking the **first technical question** (e.g., "Explain BFS"), the response showed only `<s>` instead of the actual explanation. This was caused by special model tokens not being filtered.

## Root Cause
The OpenRouter API with Mistral 7B model was returning special tokens like:
- `<s>` - Beginning of Sequence token
- `</s>` - End of Sequence token
- Other control tokens: `<|endoftext|>`, `<|im_start|>`, `<|im_end|>`

These tokens were being broadcast to the client without filtering, causing the first response to display only `<s>`.

## Solution Applied

### File: `server.js` (Line ~233-246)

**Added Special Token Filter:**
```javascript
// Filter out special tokens like <s>, </s>, <|endoftext|>, etc.
const filteredDelta = delta.replace(/<\/?s>|<\|endoftext\|>|<\|im_start\|>|<\|im_end\|>/g, '').trim();

// Only add and broadcast if there's actual content after filtering
if (filteredDelta) {
  fullResponse += filteredDelta;
  
  // Broadcast each chunk immediately to SSE clients
  broadcastEvent({ 
    role: 'assistant', 
    type: 'chunk',
    content: filteredDelta,
    isStreaming: true
  });
}
```

## What This Fixes

‚úÖ **First Question**: Now works correctly - no more `<s>` responses  
‚úÖ **Subsequent Questions**: Continue to work as before  
‚úÖ **All Modes**: Works in both Detailed and Simple modes  
‚úÖ **Streaming**: Clean streaming without control tokens  

## Testing Instructions

### Test the Fix:

1. **Refresh the web page** (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Clear any previous conversation** (refresh browser)
3. **Ask a first question**: "Explain BFS"
4. **Expected Result**: Should get a proper explanation, not `<s>`

### Test Cases:

**First Question (Previously Failed):**
- ‚ùå Before: "Explain BFS" ‚Üí Response: `<s>`
- ‚úÖ After: "Explain BFS" ‚Üí Full explanation of Breadth-First Search

**Subsequent Questions (Always Worked):**
- ‚úÖ Continue to work normally
- ‚úÖ Streaming works smoothly
- ‚úÖ No token artifacts in responses

### Additional Test Questions:
1. "What is binary search?" (explanation)
2. "Explain how quicksort works" (explanation)
3. "Write a Python function to reverse a string" (code)
4. "Tell me about hash tables" (explanation)

## Technical Details

### Regex Pattern Explained:
```javascript
/<\/?s>|<\|endoftext\|>|<\|im_start\|>|<\|im_end\|>/g
```

- `<\/?s>` - Matches `<s>` and `</s>`
- `<\|endoftext\|>` - Matches end of text token
- `<\|im_start\|>` - Matches instruction/message start
- `<\|im_end\|>` - Matches instruction/message end
- `g` flag - Global replacement (all occurrences)

### Why This Happens:
Some LLM models (especially instruction-tuned models like Mistral) use special tokens to mark:
- Beginning/end of text
- Start/end of instructions
- Conversation boundaries

These tokens are meant for model training/inference but shouldn't appear in user-facing output.

## Files Modified

### server.js
- **Line ~233-246**: Added token filtering in streaming chunk handler
- **Effect**: All streamed content is now clean

### No Changes Needed In:
- ‚úÖ public/app.js - Client-side code unchanged
- ‚úÖ public/index.html - UI unchanged
- ‚úÖ Windows app - Uses same server endpoint

## Status

**‚úÖ Fix Applied**: Special token filter active  
**‚úÖ Server Restarted**: Running on http://localhost:3000  
**‚è≥ Testing**: Awaiting user confirmation  
**‚è∏Ô∏è GitHub Push**: Holding until testing complete  

## Notes

- **No GitHub Push Yet**: As requested, changes are LOCAL ONLY
- **Ready for Testing**: Server is running with the fix
- **Windows App**: Will benefit from same fix (uses same server)
- **Web App**: Should now work correctly for first questions
